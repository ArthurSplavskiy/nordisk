								<p>Hello and welcome to another post in our magazine.</p>
								<p>Here in the magazine, we post interesting things that happen to us at Nordisk Maskin, but also tips, general
								information, guides and much more. This is done to create interest and trust for our important customers.</p>
								<p>We who work at Nordisk Maskin have a background in the construction industry, which has meant that we have chosen
								suppliers based on our own life experiences with quality in focus.</p>
								<p>As many already know, we at Nordisk Maskin are proud suppliers of Swepac's products. We have chosen Swepac as a supplier
								of soil vibrators and concrete treatment products for the very reason that quality and reliability are some important
								keywords regarding Swepac's products.</p>
								<p>During the current pandemic, our visits to suppliers have been minimized so as not to contribute to the spread of
								infection. This has obviously affected us negatively as we strive to have continuous contact with our suppliers. We
								believe that close contact strengthens the ties between us at Nordisk Maskin and the suppliers, but also creates
								security for your customers.</p>
								<p>The trip to Swepac in Ljungby started early in the morning from our premises in Link√∂ping. Arriving at their new
								factory, we met our contact person who received us warmly. We started the tour of the factory in their showroom, where
								Swepac shows all products manufactured in the factory. In the middle of the room was Swepac's new series of ground
								vibrators, models FB 155, FB 280 and FB 515.</p>
								<p>Below you get a short presentation on Swepac's new generation of ground vibrators:</p>
								<p>FB 155 is a petrol-powered forward and reverse ground vibrator that has a belt-driven hydraulic system. The handle is
								ergonomically defibrated. The walking speed is steplessly regulated with the help of the slider on the handle. The
								chassis and frame are hot-dip galvanized and the base plate is made of Hardox sheet metal to enable the longest possible
								service life.</p>
								<p>FB 280 is a diesel-powered forward and reverse ground vibrator where the vibrator system is fully hydraulic. FB 280 can
								be equipped with Swepac Connectivity which is a cloud service, in which logging time, machine data, positioning and
								theft protection are logged.</p>
								<p>FB 515 is a heavy forward and reverse ground vibrator that has a fully hydraulic vibrator system where the walking speed
								is adjustable from the de-vibrated handle. FB 515 can be equipped with Swepac Connectivity which is a cloud service
								where running time, machine data, positioning and theft protection are logged.</p>
